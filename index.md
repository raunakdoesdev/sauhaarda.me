# About Me
I'm a machine learning researcher and high school student in San Diego, California. Although I'm still in secondary school, I have a passion for academic research and have published three papers in various conferences of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. I have some experience in industry too, acting as a software developer for a startup company. In my free time I enjoy reading Stoic philosophy, stargazing, and going on walks with my dog Peanut.

Indian classical music is a fading art form which focuses predominantly on improvisations on specific melodic modes, or ragas. The improvisational nature of the Indian ragas make them very difficult to consistently record in a distributable written format. Because ragas are passed down solely through an ancient oral tradition, much of the rich knowledge of Indian ragas is dying. 

To address this issue, I created the PhonoNet deep learning system for raga detection, a tool which documents and augments the learning of Indian classical music and ragas by providing raga prediction and audio visualization.
